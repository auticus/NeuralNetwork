# NeuralNetwork
An example of a simple neural network

The code here sets up a basic neural network and has both a perceptron trainer that will teach a perceptron how to do AND and OR, 
as well as a more complicated neural network with several activation functions that will teach the machine how to do an XOR which a 
perceptron cannot learn.

As a C# developer, most of the tutorials and research material on the web deals in Python, so this is an example set up in my language of choice instead.
